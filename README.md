# HW6_WeatherDashboard

**User Story**

```
AS A traveler I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities 
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

**Acceptance Criteria**

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs:

* WHEN I search for a city, 
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city 
& that city is added to the search history
* WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city, 
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, 
the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
* WHEN I view the UV index, 
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are
favorable, moderate, or severe
* WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city, 
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, 
an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
* WHEN I click on a city in the search history, 
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

**Challenges | Comments**

```
Some of the challenges I encountered while creating this:

* I had a hard-time with some JavaScript in this. Thankfully we did our
projects the week before, and I was able to use that to follow along.
* I wanted ti use UIkits, but was having a hard time to make the
containers/columns the way I wanted to.
* I am not fully satisfied by the way the look of the Web App is,
if given more time, I would like to change it
* Time was of the essence here. I had a weird guilt when logging
into BootCamp spot and seeing it as an "overdue" assignment,
eventhough I knew it wasnt. I felt rushed.
* Also creating a GIF was hard. I could have gotten away with just an 
image, but I wanted to spice it up!
* It was a good precap of our first third of class overall
